## 🧠 Sample Math (via LaTeX / MathJax)

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Displayed math:

$$
\psi(x, t) = \sqrt{\frac{m \omega}{\pi \hbar}} \exp\left( -\frac{m \omega x^2}{2 \hbar} \right) e^{-i \omega t/2}
$$

The canonical commutation relation:

$$
[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i \hbar
$$

Schrödinger’s time-independent equation:

$$
\hat{H} \psi = E \psi
$$
